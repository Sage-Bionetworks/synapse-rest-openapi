    Asynchronously start a query. Use the returned job id and GET
    /entity/{id}/table/query/async/get</a> to get the results of the query

    Using a 'SQL like' syntax, query the current version of the rows in a
    single table. The following pseudo-syntax is the basic supported format:


    SELECT <br>

    [ALL | DISTINCT] select_expr [, select_expr ...] <br>

    FROM synapse_table_id <br>

    [WHERE where_condition] <br>

    [GROUP BY {col_name [, [col_name * ...] } <br>

    [ORDER BY {col_name [ [ASC | DESC] [, col_name [ [ASC | DESC]]}<br>

    [LIMIT row_count [ OFFSET offset ]]<br>


    <p>

    Note: Sub-queries and joining tables is not supported.

    </p>

    <p>

    This services depends on an index that is created/update asynchronously
    from table creation and update events. This means there could be short
    window of time when the index is inconsistent with the true state of the
    table. When the index is out-of-synch, then a status code of 202
    (ACCEPTED) will be returned and the response body will be a TableStatus
    object. The TableStatus will indicates the current
    status of the index including how much work is remaining until the index
    is consistent with the truth of the table.

    The 'partsMask' is an integer "mask" that can be combined into to request
    any desired part. As of this writing, the mask is defined as follows QueryBundleRequest

    <ul>

    <li>Query Results <i>(queryResults)</i> = 0x1</li>

    <li>Query Count <i>(queryCount)</i> = 0x2</li>

    <li>Select Columns <i>(selectColumns)</i> = 0x4</li>

    <li>Max Rows Per Page <i>(maxRowsPerPage)</i> = 0x8</li>

    <li>The Table Columns <i>(columnModels)</i> = 0x10</li>

    <li>Facet statistics for each faceted column <i>(facetStatistics)</i> = 0x20</li>

    <li>The sum of the file sizes <i>(sumFileSizesBytes)</i> = 0x40</li>

    </ul>

    </p>

    <p>

    For example, to request all parts, the request mask value should be: <br>
    0x1 OR 0x2 OR 0x4 OR 0x8 OR 0x10 OR 0x20 OR 0x40 = 0x7F.

    </p>

    Note: The caller must have the READ permission on the TableEntity to make this call.
