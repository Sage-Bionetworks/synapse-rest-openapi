    Create an Access Approval, thereby fulfilling an Access Requirement
    for a given user.

    Self-signed Access Approvals may be generated by the user being approved.  ACT
    Access Approvals may be generated only by the Synapse Access and Compliance Team
    (ACT).

    Since an Access Requirement may apply to multiple entities, fulfilling an Access
    Requirement provides access to all entities restricted by the fulfilled requirement.
