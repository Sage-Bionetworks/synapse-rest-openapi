    Get an Entity's benefactor.

    <p>

    The term 'benefactor' is used indicate which Entity an Entity inherits is ACL
    from. For example, a newly created Project will have its own ACL and
    therefore, it will be its own benefactor. A Folder will inherit its ACL (by
    default) from its containing Project so the Project will be the Folder's
    benefactor. This method will return the EntityHeader of an Entity's
    benefactor.
