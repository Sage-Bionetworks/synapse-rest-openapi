    Creates a Submission and sends a submission notification email to
    the submitter's team members.

    The passed request body should contain the following fields:

    <ul>

    <li>evaluationId - The ID of the Evaluation to which this Submission belongs.</li>

    <li>entityId - The ID of the Entity being submitted.</li>

    <li>versionNumber - The specific version of the Entity being submitted.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>

    A Submission must be either a Team or an Individual submission.  A Team submission
    must include a Team ID in the teamId field and the request must include a submissionEligibilityHash
    request parameter.  A Team submission may also include a list of submission contributors.
    (The submitter is taken to be a contributor and need not be included in the list.)
    An individual submission must have a null teamId, a null or empty contributor
    list, and no submissionEligibilityHash parameter.

    </p>

    <p>

    <b>Note:</b> The caller must be granted the <a href="${org.sagebionetworks.repo.model.ACCESS_TYPE}">ACCESS_TYPE.SUBMIT</a>.

    </p>

    <p>

    This call also creates an associated <a href="${org.sagebionetworks.evaluation.model.SubmissionStatus}">SubmissionStatus</a>,
    initialized with a SubmissionStatusEnum value of RECEIVED.

    </p>
