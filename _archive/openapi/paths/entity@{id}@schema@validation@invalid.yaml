    Get a single page of invalid JSON schema validation results for a
    container Entity (Project or Folder). The validation of an Entity against its bound
    schema is automatic and eventually consistent. The validation results include
    the etag of the Entity at the time of the last validation. If the returned
    etag does not match the current etag of the Entity then the results should be
    considered out-of-date.

    Note: The caller must be granted the READ permission on the container Entity.
    The results will only include children that the caller has the READ permission on.
