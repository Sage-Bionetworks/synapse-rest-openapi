    To use a JSON schema for validation, the JSON schema plus all of its
    dependency schemas must be provided to a JSON schema validator. The
    'validation' schema is simply a JSON schema with all of its dependencies
    added to the 'definitions' section of the schema, making the schema
    self-contained.

    Use this call to start an asynchronous job that will compile the 'validation'
    schema for a given JSON schema $id.

    To monitor the progress of the job and to get the final results use:
    GET /schema/type/validation/async/get/{asyncToken}
  operationId: startGetValidationSchema
  requestBody:
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          $ref: '../components/schemas/GetValidationSchemaRequest.yaml'
    required: false
  responses:

      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: ../components/schemas/AsyncJobId.yaml
