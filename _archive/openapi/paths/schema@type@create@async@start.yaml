    Start an asynchronous job to create a new JSON schema.
    A JSON schema must include an $id that is a relative URL of that schema. The
    pseudo-BNF syntax for a valid $id is as follows:

    < $id > ::= < organization name > "-" < schema name > [ "-"  < semantic version > ]
    
    < organization name > ::= < dot separated alpha numeric > 
    
    < schema name > ::= < dot separated alpha numeric >
    
    < semantic version > ::= See: https://semver.org/

    < dot separated alpha numeric > :: = < alpha numeric > ( "." < alpha numeric > )*
    
    < alpha numeric > ::= < letter > ( < identifier > )*
    
    < letter > ::= [a-zA-Z]
    
    < identifier > ::= < letter > | < digit >
    
    < digit > :: = [0-9]

    Take the following example, if organizationName="my.organization",
    schemaName="foo.Bar.json", and semanticVersion="0.1.2", then
    $id="my.organization-foo.Bar.json-0.1.2". Note: The semantic version is
    optional. When provide the semantic version is a label for a specific version
    that allows other schemas to reference it by its version. When a semantic
    version is include, that version of the schema is immutable. This means if a
    semantic version is included in a registered schema's $id, all $refs within
    the schema must also include a semantic version.

    All $ref within a JSON schema must either be references to "definitions"
    within the schema or references other registered JSON schemas. References to
    non-registered schemas is not currently supported. To reference a registered
    schema $ref should equal the $id of the referenced schema. To reference the
    example schema from above use $ref="my.organization-foo.Bar.json-0.1.2".

    Note: The semantic version of a referenced schema is optional. When the
    semantic version is excluded in a $ref the reference is assumed to reference
    the latest version of the schema. So $ref="my.organization-foo.Bar.json"
    would be a reference to the latest version of that schema. While
    $ref="my.organization-foo.Bar.json-0.1.2" would be a reference to the version
    0.1.2

    To monitor the progress of the job and to get the final results use:
    GET /schema/type/create/async/get/{asyncToken}
    
    Note: The caller must be granted the CREATE permission on the
    Organization in the schema's $id.
