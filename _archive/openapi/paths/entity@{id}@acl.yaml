    Delete the Access Control List (ACL) for a given Entity.

    <p>

    By default, Entities such as FileEntity and Folder inherit their permission
    from their containing Project. For such Entities the Project is the Entity's
    'benefactor'. This permission inheritance can be overridden by creating an
    ACL for the Entity. When this occurs the Entity becomes its own benefactor
    and all permission are determined by its own ACL.

    </p>

    <p>

    If the ACL of an Entity is deleted, then its benefactor will automatically be
    set to its parent''s benefactor. The ACL for a Project cannot be deleted.

    </p>
