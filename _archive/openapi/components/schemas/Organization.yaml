  The first step in creating new type schema in Synapse is to setup and configure
  an organization. The name of the organization serves as the root for each schema's
  $id managed by that organization. The organization name 'org.sagebionetworks'
  is reserved for the core Synapse model objects. Each organization also has an
  Access Control List (ACL) that controls who can add schemas to an organization.
  All schemas created under an Organization will be considered publicly readable
  and reference-able. Organizations are immutable
example:
  createdBy: '...'
  createdOn: '...'
  id: '...'
  name: '...'
properties:
  createdBy:
    description: 'The ID of the user that created this Organization.'
    type: string
  createdOn:
    description: 'The date this Organization was created.'
    type: string
  id:
    description: 'The Synapse identifier issued to the Organization.'
    type: string
  name:

      The name of the organization servers as the root for each schema's
      $id managed under an organization, and each name must be unique.
    type: string
title: Organization
type: object
