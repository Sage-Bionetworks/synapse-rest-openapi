  Interface for JSON schema for AccessRequirement. The Access Requirement mechanism is
  distinct from the access control list in that it is controlled not by the entity
  owner but by a separate authority: Access Requirements are created and maintained
  by the Synapse Access and Compliance Team (ACT). ACTAccessRequirements can only be
  approved by the ACT. Self-sign Access Requirements can be approved by the user
  desiring access, but said user first has to meet 'terms of use' associated with the requirement.

      Synapse employs an Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) scheme to handle concurrent
      updates. Since the E-Tag changes every time an entity is updated it is used to
      detect when a client's current representation of an object is out-of-date.
