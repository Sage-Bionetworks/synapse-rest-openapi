    Update multiple SubmissionStatuses. The maximum batch size is 500.  To
    allow upload of more than this maximum, the system supports uploading of a <i>series</i> of
    batches. Synapse employs optimistic concurrency on the series in the form of a batch token.
    Each request (except the first) must include the ''batch token'' returned in the
    response to the previous batch. If another client begins batch upload simultaneously,
    a PRECONDITION_FAILED (412) response will be generated and upload must restart
    from the first batch.  After the final batch is uploaded, the data for the Evaluation queue
    will be mirrored to the tables which support querying.  Therefore uploaded data will
    not appear in Evaluation queries until after the final batch is successfully uploaded.  It
    is the client''s responsibility to note in each batch request (1) whether it is the first
    batch in the series and (2) whether it is the last batch.  (For a single batch both
    are set to ''true''.)

    Failure to use the flags correctly risks corrupted data (due to simultaneous,
    conflicting uploads by multiple clients) or data not appearing in query results.
