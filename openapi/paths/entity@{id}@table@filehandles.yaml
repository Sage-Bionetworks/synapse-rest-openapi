    This method is used to get file handle information for rows in a
    TableEntity. The columns in the passed in RowReferenceSet need to be
    FILEHANDLEID columns and the rows in the passed in RowReferenceSet need
    to exists (a 400 will be returned if a row ID is provided that does not
    actually exist). The order of the returned rows of file handles is the
    same as the order of the rows requested, and the order of the file
    handles in each row is the same as the order of the columns requested.


    Note: The caller must have the READ permission on the TableEntity to make this call.
