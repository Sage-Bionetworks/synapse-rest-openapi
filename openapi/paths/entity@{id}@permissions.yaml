    Get the list of permission that the caller has on a given Entity.

    A User's permission on an Entity is a calculation based several factors
    including the permission granted by the Entity's ACL and the User's group
    membership. There might also be extra requirement for an Entity, such as
    special terms-of-use or special restrictions for sensitive data. This means a
    client cannot accurately calculate a User's permission on an Entity simply by
    inspecting the Entity''s ACL. Instead, all clients should use this method to
    get the calculated permission a User has on an Entity.
