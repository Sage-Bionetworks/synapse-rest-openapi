    Get the The summary statistics of the JSON schema validation results
    for a single container Entity such as a Project or Folder. Only direct children of
    the container are included in the results. The statistics include the total
    number of children in the container, and the counts for both the invalid and
    valid children. If an Entity has not been validated for the first time, or it
    does not have bound schema it will be counted as 'unknown'.

    The validation of an Entity against its bound schema is automatic and
    eventually consistent. Keep checking this method to get the latest validation
    statistics for the given container.

    Note: The caller must be granted the READ permission on the container Entity.
    The resulting statistics will only include children that the caller has the READ permission on.
