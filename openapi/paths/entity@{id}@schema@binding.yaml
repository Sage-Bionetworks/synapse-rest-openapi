    Bind a JSON schema to an Entity. The bound schema will be used to validate
    the Entity''s metadata (annotations). Any child Entity that does not have a
    bound schema will inherit the first bound schema found in its hierarchy.

    Only a single schema can be bound to an Entity at a time. If you have more
    than one schema to bind to an Entity you will need to create and bind a
    single composition schema using keywords such as 'anyOf', 'allOf' or 'oneOf'
    that defines how the schemas should be used for validation.

    Note: The caller must be granted the UPDATE ermission on the Entity to bind.
