      Moves an entity and its descendants out of the trash can to a new
      parent.

      NOTE:  This operation cannot be completed if the original parent has been
      deleted (unless the caller is a member of the Synapse Access and Compliance
      Team).
      The service will return a NotFoundException.  This is because of the potential
      security hole arising from allowing access requirements
      on folders:  If an entity is in a restricted folder and then deleted, it cannot
      be restored unless the new parent has the same restriction level as the original
      one.
