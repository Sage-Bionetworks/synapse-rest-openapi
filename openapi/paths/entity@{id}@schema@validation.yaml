    Get the validation results of an Entity against its bound JSON schema.
    The validation of an Entity against its bound schema is automatic and eventually
    consistent. The validation results include the etag of the Entity at the time
    of the last validation. If the returned etag does not match the current etag
    of the Entity then the results should be considered out-of-date. If an Entity
    has not been validated for the first time, or if the Entity does not have a
    bound schema, this method will return a 404 (not-found). Keep checking for
    the latest validation results.

    Note: The caller must be granted the READ permission on the Entity.
