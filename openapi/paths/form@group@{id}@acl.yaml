    Update the Access Control List (ACL) for a FormGroup.

    The following define the permissions in this context:

    * READ - Grants read access to the group. READ does not grant access to FormData of
    the group.
    * CHANGE_PERMISSIONS - Grants access to update the group's ACL.
    * SUBMIT - Grants access to both create and submit FormData to the group.
    * READ_PRIVATE_SUBMISSION - Grants administrator's access to the submitted FormData,
    including both FormData reads and status updates. This permission should be
    reserved for the service account that evaluates submissions.

    Users automatically have read/update access to FormData that they create.

    Note: The caller must have the CHANGE_PERMISSIONS permission on the identified
    group to update the group's ACL.
